# Security Policy & Threat Model

WatchTower is a multi-tenant monitoring platform: every user's monitors,
incidents, logs and alert channels are private to them, and the service holds
outbound credentials for third-party endpoints. This document states what we
defend against, how, and — just as importantly — what we currently do not.

It began as a four-person hackathon project. Several items below are honest
records of accepted risk rather than claims of completeness.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Open a private security advisory on the GitHub repository, or email the
maintainer listed in `CONTRIBUTORS.md`. Please do not open a public issue for an
unpatched vulnerability.

Include: affected endpoint or component, reproduction steps, and what an
attacker gains. We aim to acknowledge within 72 hours.

---

## 1. Assets

Ranked by what an attacker gains from compromising them.

| Asset | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Outbound monitor credentials** | Auth headers for customers' *internal* APIs. Compromise pivots the attacker into systems that are not ours. Highest value in the system. |
| **User credentials** | Password hashes, reset tokens, session JWTs. |
| **Tenant monitoring data** | Which endpoints a customer runs, their URLs, and when they were down. Commercially sensitive and a reconnaissance map of their infrastructure. |
| **Notification channels** | Email addresses and webhook URLs — an abuse channel for phishing under our name. |
| **The scheduler itself** | Makes authenticated outbound requests on a timer. An attacker who controls monitor URLs has a request-forgery primitive. |

## 2. Trust boundaries

```
 Browser ──HTTPS──▶ Express (REST)     ─┐
    │                                   ├─▶ DAO layer ──▶ MongoDB
    └───WSS───▶ Socket.IO (rooms)      ─┘
                       │
 Scheduler (leader) ───┴──▶ outbound HTTP to customer-supplied URLs
                            outbound SMTP / webhooks
```

Untrusted input crosses three boundaries: the browser (request bodies, query
strings, socket frames), **the monitored targets** (their response bodies,
headers, redirects and TLS certificates), and the AI provider's output.
Responses from monitored targets are attacker-controlled from our perspective —
anyone can point a monitor at a server they own.

## 3. Threats and controls

### T1 — Cross-tenant data access *(the defect this project actually had)*

A data-exposure bug was patched late in the hackathon (commit `e7c8494`) with no
test to keep it closed. Phase 0 confirmed the REST leaks were shut, but tenancy
was enforced *by convention*: every controller individually had to remember
`{ userId }`. One forgotten filter would reopen it.

**Controls**

- **Owner-scoped DAO layer** (`src/dao/`). Queries take an owner id as their
  first argument and **throw `UnscopedQueryError` if it is missing or
  malformed**. There is no code path that reads a collection unscoped.
- The owner filter is applied by the DAO and **intersected** (`$and`) with any
  caller filter, so a hostile `{ userId: <someone else> }` yields an empty
  result rather than a wider one. Queries fail closed.
- `create()` stamps ownership from the session; `userId` in a request body is
  ignored.
- By-id misses return **404, not 403**, so the API cannot be used to confirm
  that an id exists.
- Zod schemas strip undeclared fields at the edge — a second, independent layer.

**Verification** — `tests/security/tenancy.test.js` and `dao.test.js`: two
tenants with identical data shapes; every read path asserted by id and by list.
`aggregate()` forces the owner `$match` into the first stage.

### T2 — Cross-tenant leakage over WebSockets

Realtime is the easiest place to leak tenancy: rooms are invisible in the HTTP
surface, and a single `io.emit` reaches every connected customer.

**Controls**

- JWT verified **at handshake**; a socket with no valid token never connects.
  A token that verifies but carries no subject is also rejected — an unscopeable
  socket must not exist.
- Each socket joins exactly one room, derived from the **verified token**, never
  from client input. There is deliberately no `join`/`subscribe` handler, so
  membership cannot be widened after connect.
- All tenant data goes through `emitToUser()`, which is room-addressed. Nothing
  in the codebase calls `io.emit`.
- `emitToUser` with a falsy id is a **no-op, never a broadcast**: the failure
  mode of a bug here must be "nobody is notified".
- A second, **unauthenticated** Socket.IO server existed at `src/config/socket.js`
  (no `io.use`, no rooms). It was unused but one stray import from being live.
  **Deleted.**

**Verification** — `tests/security/socket.test.js`, including a test that Bob's
socket receives nothing when an event is emitted to Alice.

### T3 — NoSQL operator injection

`{"email": {"$gt": ""}}` in a login body would match the first user in the
collection and return a session for an account the caller does not own.

**Controls** — `express-mongo-sanitize` strips `$`-prefixed and dotted keys from
body, query and params; `hpp` collapses duplicated parameters so an array cannot
be smuggled where a scalar is expected.

> **Express 5 note.** Both libraries work by reassigning `req.query`, which is a
> getter-only property in Express 5 — unpatched, every request 500s. A shim
> (`makeQueryWritable`) redefines the slot as writable. Verified against
> express 5.2.1 / express-mongo-sanitize 2.2.0 / hpp 0.2.3.

### T4 — Credential theft from the database

Monitors may store `Authorization` headers for targets behind auth. Plaintext
storage would mean one database dump hands an attacker working credentials to
every customer's internal APIs — strictly worse than losing our own data.

**Controls**

- **AES-256-GCM** envelope encryption (`src/utils/crypto.js`), format
  `v1:<iv>:<tag>:<ciphertext>`. GCM is authenticated, so tampered ciphertext
  fails loudly instead of decrypting to garbage that then gets sent as a header.
- Key from `CREDENTIALS_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, never in the repo. The version prefix
  exists so the key can be rotated without guessing how a row was written.
- The field is `select: false` — it cannot be returned by accident; the
  scheduler opts in explicitly. The API returns only a `hasAuthHeaders` boolean.
- If no key is configured, storing credentials **errors** rather than silently
  writing plaintext into a field named "encrypted".

### T5 — Credential leakage via redirect

A monitored endpoint we send an `Authorization` header to could `302` to a host
the attacker controls. An open redirect on the customer's side would become
credential exfiltration on ours.

**Control** — outbound credentials are bound to the monitor's original origin
and dropped the moment a redirect leaves it.

### T6 — Brute force and credential stuffing

The single 300-req/15-min limiter permitted roughly 20 password guesses a minute,
indefinitely.

**Controls**

- `/api/auth/login|register|verify|change-password`: **10 per 15 min**, with
  `skipSuccessfulRequests` so a legitimate user behind NAT is not locked out by
  their own success.
- `/api/auth/forgot-password|reset-password`: **5 per hour** — each request
  sends real email, so an unthrottled endpoint is both an enumeration oracle and
  a way to spend our SMTP reputation spamming a third party.
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt; `password` is `select: false`.

### T7 — Secret leakage through logs

`registerUser` opened with `console.log(req.body)`, writing every new user's
**plaintext password** to stdout and onward into the platform's log aggregator,
where it is retained and searchable.

**Control** — removed. Never log a request body on a credential endpoint.
Phase 6 adds structured logging with explicit redaction.

### T8 — CORS misconfiguration

**Controls** — env-driven allow-list. `config.js` **throws at boot** if
`CORS_ORIGIN` contains `*`, or if it is empty in production. Socket.IO now uses
the same allow-list as the REST API rather than a separate single-origin value.

### T9 — Server-side request forgery *(accepted risk — see §5)*

The scheduler fetches user-supplied URLs. A user can point a monitor at
`http://169.254.169.254/` or an internal address and infer reachability from
status codes and latency.

**Partial controls** — response bodies are never returned to the user, only
status code and timings; bodies are capped at 512 KB; redirects capped at 5;
every check has a hard deadline. **Not yet mitigated:** no allow/deny-list on
resolved IP ranges.

### T10 — Denial of service against monitored targets

An unbounded scheduler is an outbound attack tool. Controls: per-monitor
interval floor of **5 s**, bounded worker pool, per-monitor circuit breaker, and
skip-not-queue overlap handling so a struggling target is never piled onto. See
`docs/SCHEDULER.md`.

### T11 — XSS via injected content in alert emails

Monitor titles are free text, and AI summaries derive from remote servers'
error strings — both attacker-influenced, both previously interpolated raw into
alert email HTML.

**Control** — all template interpolation is HTML-escaped
(`src/notifications/templates.js`).

---

## 4. Authentication & session model

- JWT in an **httpOnly, `sameSite: 'strict'`** cookie; `secure` in production.
- `sameSite: 'strict'` is the primary CSRF control. There is no separate CSRF
  token — see §5.
- Same cookie and secret for REST and Socket.IO, from a single
  `config.AUTH_COOKIE` constant so the two cannot drift apart.

---

## 5. Known limitations — accepted, not solved

Stated plainly because a threat model that claims completeness is not credible.

| # | Limitation | Risk | Why it stands |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **`AUTO_VERIFY_USERS` defaults to on** — registration skips email verification | Account spam under arbitrary addresses | Was a hardcoded `user.isVerified = true` marked "remove in production". Now a single env var, and it warns loudly at boot in production. Default preserved so the live demo keeps working; set `AUTO_VERIFY_USERS=false` to close it. |
| 2 | **No SSRF allow-list** on monitor URLs | Internal network probing (T9) | Needs DNS-resolution-time IP filtering with re-validation before connect to avoid DNS rebinding. Real work, not a config flag. |
| 3 | **No CSRF token** | Relies solely on `sameSite: 'strict'` | Adequate against classic CSRF in current browsers, but defence in depth is missing. |
| 4 | **JWT returned in the response body** as well as the cookie | Widens exposure to any XSS | Kept because the current frontend reads it. Should be cookie-only. |
| 5 | **No token revocation** | A stolen JWT is valid until expiry | Needs a denylist or short-lived tokens plus refresh. |
| 6 | **No audit log** of security-relevant actions | Weak forensics after an incident | Notification dispatch is logged; auth events are not. |
| 7 | **Secrets in platform env vars**, no managed secret store or rotation | Broad blast radius if the platform account is compromised | Appropriate to the current deployment tier. |
| 8 | **No account lockout** after repeated failures | Rate limiting only | Lockout introduces its own DoS vector; deliberately deferred. |
| 9 | **Dependency vulnerabilities unaudited** at time of writing | Unknown | `npm audit` reports outstanding advisories. Phase 5 adds an audit gate to CI. |

---

## 6. Security testing

`tests/security/` — 55 assertions covering tenancy isolation by id and by list
across monitors, incidents, logs and metrics; DAO refusal of unscoped queries;
Socket.IO handshake auth and room isolation; NoSQL operator injection; and
credential encryption at rest.

Run with `npm test --prefix Backend`.

These are regression tests. The point is not that the system is secure today —
it is that the specific defect this project actually shipped cannot come back
silently.
